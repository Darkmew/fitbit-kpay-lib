# What is this?
The library to use Fitbit clockfaces and apps with the <a href="https://k-pay.io" target="_blank">k-pay system</a>

# How to test
This is a completely functional Fitbit app for the Fitbit Ionic or Versa watches. Import in Fitbit Studio (or build with the command line SDK) and run it in the simulator to test.

# How to contribute
Any contribution is welcome, please create a pull request for any changes you think would contribute to make this library better for everyone using k-pay.

We are especially looking for ways to decrease the memory usage of the lib without sacrificing functionality!

Do not waste time saving memory by making filenames shorter or doing other things UglifyJS is way better at. This lib is processed with UglifyJS before it's released to the k-pay website.
